## 🧪 Adding New Features

### Want to make ChaosWeb even more chaotic?

- Feel free to experiment with wild and unconventional ideas!
- All ideas are welcome, but remember, **ChaosWeb’s goal is to confuse and entertain**, so your features should align with this purpose.


Please create an issue before working on any major new feature so we can discuss it!

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Even chaos has bugs! If you find something that’s not working as intended (or too well-ordered for ChaosWeb standards):

- Open an issue with a clear description of the problem.
- Include steps to reproduce the bug, along with screenshots or other relevant info.

## 🌟 Code Style Guide

- **HTML/CSS**: Clean, well-indented, and readable.
- **JavaScript**: Use `const` and `let` over `var`. Keep functions small and modular.
- **Comments**: Comment any tricky or confusing code to help future contributors.

## ⚠️ Code of Conduct

**Please be kind and respectful when contributing. The goal is to learn, have fun, and create something truly chaotic together!**
