# 🔒 Security Policy

Welcome to **ChaosWeb**! We aim to foster creativity and experimentation in web design by challenging the norms. However, despite the chaos, security is still a priority. This document outlines the security policies and guidelines for reporting any vulnerabilities related to this project.

## 📅 Supported Versions

ChaosWeb is actively maintained. Please ensure you're using the latest version of the project, as older versions may not include important security updates.

| Version     | Supported          |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Latest (main branch) | ✅ Fully supported |
| Older versions | ❌ No longer supported |

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within **ChaosWeb**, we highly appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly. To report a vulnerability:

1. **Contact us via email**: Please send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with details of the vulnerability. Include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and potential impact of the issue.
2. **Response Time**: We aim to respond to security issues within **48 hours** and will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.
3. **Do not disclose publicly**: To protect users, please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it.

## 🔐 What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:
- A clear and detailed description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, if possible.
- Potential impact and any suggestions for mitigating the issue.
- Your contact details for follow-up (optional).

## 🚨 Scope

We appreciate vulnerability reports related to:
- Code injections (JavaScript, HTML, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Authentication bypass
- Sensitive data exposure
- Any other security flaws that may impact users or contributors

Please note, due to the deliberately chaotic nature of the project, **design-related chaos, confusing navigation, and quirky UI behavior are intentional features** and not considered security vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Thank You!

We greatly value the time and effort it takes to identify and report security issues, and we thank you for helping us keep **ChaosWeb** safe and secure for everyone!
